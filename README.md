# Obtaining_MLCS2k2_model_vectors

Here we have the step-by-step derivation of the models vectors from Multicolor Light-Curve Shapes 2k2 from Jha et al. 2007, as well as the derivations for the previous MLCS and LCS versions.

These models are used to standardize Light-Curves from type Ia Supernovae, correcting for intrisic dispersions. Afterwards these probes can be used to constrain the Hublle constant and the dark energy EoS parameter.
